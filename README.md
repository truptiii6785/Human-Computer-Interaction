Feel Heard - Onn Demand Emotional support and online therapy service


We all have problems, but a lot of us don't have people we can talk to. Sometimes we have them, but the issue you would like to talk about is too sensitive for them. Or maybe you'd like the freedom of anonymity to truly say what you hold within. 

We are working on a platform that provides people anonymity and the freedom to speak freely with a person who will listen. Just listen, without judgment, without handing out patronizing advice. If the member so desires, we intend to have online therapy services as well. We shall also have general support forums, and blog-based content for articles related to mental health issues, and help sections with specific step-based psychology-backed ways to deal with a range of emotional and mental health issues and topics. This idea is based off of the website 7Cups, also known as 7 Cups of Tea, and we plan to improve upon their model from an empathetic and user experience point of view. Find it here: https://www.7cups.com/

The platform will allow people to join either as MEMBERS, who can participate in forums, read blog articles and guides, and to request conversations with LISTENERS. Listeners are cleared to do everything members can, but are also authorised to LISTEN to members, be there for them, and provide basic emotional support and hold space for members.
